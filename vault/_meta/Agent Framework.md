## Adding New Agents

To add a new agent:

1. Create `.opencode/agent/{agent-name}.md`
2. Include frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   description: One-line description
   mode: subagent
   tools:
     read: true
     write: true
     edit: true
     bash: true
     glob: true
     grep: true
   ---
   ```
3. Document the agent's role, expertise, and workflow
4. Update coordinator.md to list the new agent
5. Optionally create a `/command` for quick invocation
6. Document in this file
