# Product Vision (Example: Todo App)

**This is an example.** Replace with YOUR product vision.

## What We're Building

A simple todo application demonstrating Balustrade patterns.

## Why It Exists

To show how product documentation works in the Balustrade meta-framework. This todo app has:
- Clear product docs (this file)
- Architecture decisions (separate file)
- Feature specifications (separate file)

## Core Value

Not the todo app itself - it's the **documentation patterns** that matter.

## User Goals

Users want to:
- See examples of vault structure
- Understand how to document their own product
- Learn the pattern, then replace this with their vision

## Success Metrics

Balustrade users successfully:
- Delete this example
- Add their own product vision
- Follow the documentation patterns
- Customize for their domain

---

## For Your Project

Replace this file with YOUR product vision:
- What problem does your product solve?
- Who are your users?
- What's your unique value proposition?
- What are your success metrics?

Keep it evergreen (no temporal language like "will", "soon", "recently").
