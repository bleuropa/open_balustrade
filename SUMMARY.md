## Key Features

### 1. Language Agnostic
Works with any tech stack:
- Node, Python, Ruby, Go
- React, Vue, Angular
- iOS, Android, Flutter
- Rust, Elixir, C++, anything

### 2. Zero Dependencies
Example app has NO package.json, NO build step.
Just Node built-ins + vanilla JS + CDN Tailwind.

### 3. Framework Focused
Real value is `.opencode/` and `vault/`, not the example app.
Delete example, keep framework.

### 4. Teaching By Example
Shows patterns via minimal todo app.
Then you replace with your project.

### 5. Fully Customizable
Every convention is an example.
Change hooks for YOUR rules.
Add YOUR agents.
Document YOUR product.

---

## What Gets Enforced (Examples)

These are demonstrations - customize for your needs:

**Pre-commit blocks**:
- Temporal language in evergreen docs (optional)
- Invalid task status (optional)
- Missing task fields (optional)
- Debugger statements (optional)
- Merge conflict markers (recommended)

**Pre-commit warns**:
- Task size >7 items (adjustable)
- Branch-task misalignment (optional)
- PROJECT_STATUS.md out of sync (optional)

**Commit-msg validates**:
- Conventional commit format (customizable)

**Post-commit updates**:
- PROJECT_STATUS.md timestamp (automatic)
- Recent files list (automatic)

---

## Quick Start (3 Steps)

1. **Fork** this repo
2. **Delete** example-app/
3. **Add** your code and customize

That's it.

---

## Customization Checklist

- [ ] Delete example-app/
- [ ] Add your code
- [ ] Update PROJECT_STATUS.md
- [ ] Replace vault/product/ docs
- [ ] Replace vault/architecture/ docs
- [ ] Replace vault/features/ docs
- [ ] Customize .opencode/hooks/
- [ ] Add your agents
- [ ] Update dev container
- [ ] Install hooks: `bash .opencode/hooks/install-hooks.sh`

See CUSTOMIZATION.md for details.

---

## Token Efficiency

**Problem**: Scanning vault for status costs 5000+ tokens

**Solution**: Read PROJECT_STATUS.md (500 tokens)

**Result**: ~10x reduction in common operations

**Usage**:
```
/status     # Reads PROJECT_STATUS.md only
            # Fast, cheap, always current
```

---

## Multi-Agent Ready

Dev container enables:
- Multiple services in one environment
- Configurable ports
- Shared workspace
- Agent coordination

See vault/how-to/Dev Container Setup.md

---

## Philosophy

### Not Prescriptive
Shows HOW to enforce conventions, not WHICH to enforce.

### Language Agnostic
Works with any stack. Framework is about PM, not code.

### Minimal Example
Todo app is ~100 lines. Easy to understand and delete.

### Framework First
Real value: `.opencode/` patterns and `vault/` structure.

### Convention Over Configuration
Standard structure, predictable workflows, automated maintenance.

### Determinism Over Flexibility
Hooks enforce automatically. No relying on memory.

### Token Efficiency First
Every design optimizes for minimal context usage.

---

## What Makes This Different

**Not a framework**: No npm install, no CLI, just patterns
**Not opinionated about code**: Only about PM and docs
**Not language-specific**: Works with any stack
**Teaching by example**: Minimal todo app shows patterns

---

## Future: create-balustrade CLI

May eventually build:
```bash
npx create-balustrade init
```

For now: **fork and modify**.

## File Count

- **58 total files**

- 2 example app files

**Lines of code**: ~100 (example app)
**Lines of framework**: ~8000+ (docs, hooks, commands, agents, skills, templates, examples)

Framework is documentation and patterns, not code.

## The Point

Balustrade is NOT:
- A todo app
- A Node.js framework
- A prescriptive system

Balustrade IS:
- A reference implementation
- Language-agnostic patterns
- Customizable for YOUR project

**Fork it. Delete the example. Make it yours.**

The balustrade guides your path. Now build.
